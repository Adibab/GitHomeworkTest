My name is Adiba. My favorite sport is football. I like it because this sport has the effect of relieving stress and bringing people together, as a remedy to help them temporarily forget the worries and worries of daily life. My favorite food is lamb curry. I like it because easy to cook and can be used to eat/prepare many dishes for example- biriyani, khichri.

 I am a mum of one kid. Every day I do my family commitment, take care my kid by doing activity and at the end of the day I do my study. I try to learn something that is related to coding which currently my passion. I believe every day doing multi-tasks is challenging. For this reason when I do any task I make sure that I am working with attention to detail to avoid mistakes, putting best effort to get maximum output & making plan to utilize the mentioned timeline so the goal is achieved successfully.
